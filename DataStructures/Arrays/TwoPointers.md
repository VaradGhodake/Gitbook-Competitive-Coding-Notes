Two pointers is really an easy and effective technique which is typically used for searching pairs in an array.
 Two pointers:
At either ends and decide which one to move
One faster and one slower
Maintain subarray size of Kâ€™s props

```py
class Solution:
    def moveZeroes(self, nums: List[int]) -> None:
        n = len(nums)
        z = 0
        p = 0
            
        while (not p == (n - 1)):
            while z < n and nums[z]:
                z += 1 
            
            p = z + 1

            while p < n and (not nums[p]):
                p += 1
            
            if p >= n or z >= n:
                break

            nums[z], nums[p] = nums[p], nums[z]
            
        return nums
