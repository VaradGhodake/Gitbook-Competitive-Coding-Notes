### Instructions
 <br />
* Important thing is to understand how long the loop should run. That is, until the end node or `None` after the end node. <br />
* Using multiple pointers is common, check if that helps. Also, be sure which one of these should be your point of reference. That might make a difference. (Check _reverse linked list_ question)  <br />
* To avoid many `if conditions`, you can declare a `None` node and use it as dummy or `prev` _(reverse linked list)_
* Can treat a linked list as a graph: _linked list cycle_
