Dynamic programming can be applied if the problem can be divided into overlapping subproblems that can be solved independently.\nThere are two uses for dynamic programming:\n\nFinding an optimal solution: We want to find a solution that is as large as possible or as small as possible.\nCounting the number of solutions: We want to calculate the total number of possible solutions.\n\nOptimal Solution\neg. 0/1 Knapsack, partitions: exact sum, minimum sum difference\nKnapsack program:\nclass Solution:\n    def knapsack(self, weights, values, bag_weight):\n        table = [[0] * (bag_weight + 1)] for _ in (len(values) + 1)]\n\n        for i in range(0, len(values)+ 1):\n            for weight in range(0, bag_weight + 1):\n                if(i == 0 or weight == 0):\n                    table[i][weight] = 0\n                elif(weight \nFor exact sum subarray and minimum difference subarrays: \nTrue or False for each cell.

Top-down Dynamic Programming\nTop-down Dynamic Programming can be thought of as optimized backtracking. It relies on the observation that once we determine that a certain subproblem solution, this result will never change. \nIf the solution is not known, perform backtracking again.\nenum Index {\n    GOOD, BAD, UNKNOWN\n}\n\npublic class Solution {\n    Index[] memo;\n\n    public boolean canJumpFromPosition(int position, int[] nums) {\n        if (memo[position] != Index.UNKNOWN) {\n            return memo[position] == Index.GOOD ? true : false;\n        }\n\n        int furthestJump = Math.min(position + nums[position], nums.length - 1);\n        for (int nextPosition = position + 1; nextPosition \n3. Bottom-up Dynamic Programming\nTop-down to bottom-up conversion is done by eliminating recursion. In practice, this achieves better performance as we no longer have the method stack overhead and might even benefit from some caching. More importantly, this step opens up possibilities for future optimization. The recursion is usually eliminated by trying to reverse the order of the steps from the top-down approach.\nenum Index {\n    GOOD, BAD, UNKNOWN\n}\n\npublic class Solution {\n    public boolean canJump(int[] nums) {\n        Index[] memo = new Index[nums.length];\n        for (int i = 0; i = 0; i--) {\n            int furthestJump = Math.min(i + nums[i], nums.length - 1);\n            for (int j = i + 1; j \n"},"Miscellaneous/":{"url":"Miscellaneous/","title":"Miscellaneous","keywords":"","body":"Miscellaneous\n"},"Miscellaneous/Stocks.html":{"url":"Miscellaneous/Stocks.html","title":"Stocks","keywords":"","body":"Stocks\n1 transaction\nhttps://www.geeksforgeeks.org/maximum-difference-between-two-elements/ \nKeep track of the minimum element found so far, calculate the difference between the current and minimum found so far. \nUpdate the maximum difference if necessary.\nAt most 2 transactions\nhttps://www.geeksforgeeks.org/maximum-profit-by-buying-and-selling-a-share-at-most-twice/ \nA similar approach to one transaction limit, maintain the minimum till that element and similar for i + 1 and till the end of the List.\nAny number of transactions\nhttps://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stock-buy-sell/ \nLocal minima List[i] = List[i + 1]\nBuy at local minima and sell at local maxima\nK number of transactions\nhttps://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-iv/discuss/54117/Clean-Java-DP-solution-with-comment \nDynamic programming\n"},"Miscellaneous/Intervals.html":{"url":"Miscellaneous/Intervals.html","title":"Intervals","keywords":"","body":"Interval problems\nhttps://www.geeksforgeeks.org/merging-intervals/ \nMerge one by one after sorting based on starting time\nhttps://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/356520 \nKeep a running count of the number of overlapping intervals\n"},"Miscellaneous/InterestingMiscellaneous.html":{"url":"Miscellaneous/InterestingMiscellaneous.html","title":"Interesting Miscellaneous","keywords":"","body":"Need to find nth smallest or largest\nUse max or min-heap or partial sort: quicksort variation\n"},"PythonicTricks/":{"url":"PythonicTricks/","title":"Pythonic Tricks","keywords":"","body":"Pythonic Tricks\nSort dictionary by value\n{k: v for k, v in sorted(x.items(), key=lambda item: item[1])}\n\nMost frequent in an array or a string\nfrom collections import Counter\nC = Counter(list/string)\nC.most_common(n) #returns a list of top n\n\n"},"BehavioralQuestions.html":{"url":"BehavioralQuestions.html","title":"Behavioral Questions","keywords":"","body":"Behavioral Questions\n\nWhat was a challenge or problem that you faced?\nTell me about a time when you were not able to deliver on time and what did you do?\nIs it better to have direct interaction with the customer?\nAnd some follow up questions based on my answers \n\n\nAll my answers were drawn from experience, I made sure I mentioned specifics, not just a vague answer.
