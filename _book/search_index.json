Dynamic programming can be applied if the problem can be divided into overlapping subproblems that can be solved independently.\nThere are two uses for dynamic programming:\n\nFinding an optimal solution: We want to find a solution that is as large as possible or as small as possible.\nCounting the number of solutions: We want to calculate the total number of possible solutions.\n\nOptimal Solution\neg. 0/1 Knapsack, partitions: exact sum, minimum sum difference\nKnapsack program:\nclass Solution:\n    def knapsack(self, weights, values, bag_weight):\n        table = [[0] * (bag_weight + 1)] for _ in (len(values) + 1)]\n\n        for i in range(0, len(values)+ 1):\n            for weight in range(0, bag_weight + 1):\n                if(i == 0 or weight == 0):\n                    table[i][weight] = 0\n                elif(weight \nFor exact sum subarray and minimum difference subarrays: \nTrue or False for each cell.
