#### Subarrays
##### Optimization checks: <br />
1. Two pointers 
2. Sliding window with running values 
3. Prefix array: if we need to apply brute force at any point 

##### From all subarrays of size K:

Requires all subarrays of all sizes and find all where a constraint is matched: <br />

Sliding window with two pointers <br />
Left move: if product is more than the constraint <br />
Right move: everytime unless the product is more than the constraint 

Catch: Each addition of the element produces `(end_index - (start_index - 1))` more subarrays <br />
Catch: Which implies -- subarray of size d produces `d * (d + 1)/2` different subarrays

Prefix array to store constraint related data (sorted) <br />
Binary search + two pointers to find ALL subarrays of that size satisfying the constraint

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/number-of-subarrays-with-odd-sum/

Prefix array but instead of sum, store `sum modulo 2` <br />
`final_answer = prefix_arr[0] * prefix_arr[1]`


##### Operation on all of subarrays:
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/xor-subarray-xors/

Catch: ith element frequency in all subarrays: `(i + 1) * (n - i)` <br />
Desired quantity at the end of the whole domain traversal

Keep current value running and max/min: <br />
* Including the element <br />
* Excluding the element: basically new subsequence start <br />

Looks like DP question but we donâ€™t have to refer older values as we are dealing subarrays, not subsequences. Answer till  previous is stored in the comparison step of current and absolute max/min.

maxVal and minVal at each value during iteration. If negative, swap them before multi, other things similar to maximum subarray sum
