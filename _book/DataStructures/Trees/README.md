# Trees

#### General tips:
* Need to brave and innovative: find the crux or a pattern of append
* The answer is always very simple. Imagine a simple tree with a root node with a left and right child
* Check if a helper function can make life easier.
* Recursion. Recursion. Recursion.
* Tweaks here and there, go for the simplest solution first. Donâ€™t just jump to recursion.
* Check which kind of traversal might be the best. Inorder DFS or level-wise BFS.
