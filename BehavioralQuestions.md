# Behavioral Questions
1. What was a challenge or problem that you faced?
2. Tell me about a time when you were not able to deliver on time and what did you do?
3. Is it better to have direct interaction with the customer?
And some follow up questions based on my answers <br />

> All my answers were drawn from experience, I made sure I mentioned specifics, not just a vague answer. One answer from my recent graduate college project, two from my previous work experience.
