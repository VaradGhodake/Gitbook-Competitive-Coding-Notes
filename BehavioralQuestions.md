* What is the feedback you get for your work and how had you improve?
> Whenever I'm working on important projects, I try to seek constructive feedback from my peers and managers. I think it's an absolute necessity; it improves the quality of the work more often than not. Whenever I receive a feedback, I get more clarifications and destruct it so nothing gets lost in the translation. <br />
> Thinking on a broader scale when designing an application. Shouldn't have blinkers just about finishing a project.
* What is one weakness you have?
> I would say "restlessness" is the one weakness I have. Once I start working on some task or a project i tend to neglect non-work stuff which, to be fair, isn't healthy mentally and physically. It does have its benefits given I intend to work in fast-paced environments where i can put this restlessness to use but there's also another side to it. Prioritizing, planning and balancing that plan with actions is equally important -- A person can only have so much bandwidth. I've started prioritizing and plan my day accordingly.
* What kind of work environment do you flourish in?
> I find the impact of my work motivational. I think I'll flourish in a fast-paced, team-work based environment focused on innovation and creativity. Given my curious nature, I relish collaborating with Subject Matter Experts and glean important aspects of software engineering from their "wisdom of production".
* How did you find out about this opportunity and what interested you?
> I have a couple of years of experience in the domain of High Frequency Trading. I am very much aware of IMC's presence in this space and I admire the culture here.
> I've heard great things about the firm but the one strikes me the most is the fact that organizational hierarchy doesn't stop one from bringing their innovative ideas to the table. I think this kind environment will be very conducive for my growth as a software professional.
* Why did you choose your college?
> Georgia Tech well known to be the best graduate school for computing systems and distributed systems, subdomains of computer science that I'm very interested in. Coursework also perfectly compliments my professional experience so far and what I intend to dive deeper in the future which lies at the intersection of non-tech fields and high performance computing.
* What is your favourite project? Explain it to a non-technical person
> Let's say a person wants to buy some candies, shoes and jackets for their trip. They can either go to different stores around the town, gather all the things they need or they can just walk up to the nearest mall and shop efficiently and with less hassle. The first approach adds a lot of overhead in terms of fuel consumption, time, etc <br />
> Similarly, a global firm with geographically scattered offices can have language silos. They have different repositories or "shops" to store perticular language packages and binaries. These different shops is an inefficient way of querying packages. Therefore, I deployed and maintained a universal artifact repository which is kind of like a "mall of binaries" and built various plugins to reduce the aformentioned overhead. <br />
> This one stop solution is currently serving more than 1 million binaries at the firm with 0 seconds of downtime.
