# General instructions

#### Problem solving
* Brute-force approach first
* Keep on optimizing code
* Remember runtimes of python built-in functions and libraries

#### Code writing
* OOP: use `class`, `methods`, and class variables
* Use docstrings if possible
* Helper functions to maintain some level of abstraction
* Property, getters-setters to decorate code further
* Use brackets where ever possible: avoids stupid mistakes and improves code readability
